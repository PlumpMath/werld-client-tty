TODO
* discover why invalid data is being intermitently sent on
  werld_client_register().

* don't allow players to walk through each other.

* send player name size in the header.

* merge tty and ui?

* don't depend on sizeof(struct) since GCC may pad struct alignment.

* in the future, when a player moves the server will not respond with the
  entire player list, so we'll be able to refresh the moving player's message
  list more intelligently than erasing and drawing the list for every player
  in the list.

* fix broken messages once and for all.

* don't allow players to walk across screen boundaries.

* work with wide characters.

* using the new 'net' module breaks messages. discover why.

* generate data shared between projects (e.g. response types) programatically
  from metadata.

* don't allow empty player names on input screen.

* disconsider empty message input.

DONE
* handle disconnect responses (0 bytes) gracefully.
* send event on disconnect, so that other clients see you disapear.
* make werld_client_handle_response() delegate responses.
* create message bar.
* merge player_message_list and player_list.
* make walking and chatting work flawlessly.
* create status bar.
* iterate on read()s and write()s and make sure all data is transmitted.
