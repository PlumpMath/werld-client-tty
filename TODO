TODO
* discover why invalid data is being intermitently sent on
  werld_client_register().

* don't allow players to walk through each other.

* create status bar.

* iterate on read()s and write()s and make sure all data is transmitted.

* investigate whether or not it's possible to refactor player_message_list and
  message_list into one module, where the list would actually be a queue and
  each node would have the player's id.

  struct message_queue {
    char *message;
    int player_id;
    time_t created_at;
    struct message_queue *next;
  }

  This would decrease a lot of complexity.

DONE
* handle disconnect responses (0 bytes) gracefully.
* send event on disconnect, so that other clients see you disapear.
* make werld_client_handle_response() delegate responses.
* create message bar.
* merge player_message_list and player_list.
